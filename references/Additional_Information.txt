Project Aim:
Help the business to automate the credit card routing via a predictive model. Such a model should increase the
payment success rate by finding the best possible PSP for each transaction and at the same time keep the
transaction fees low.

1. Data-Set: Credit Card Routing for Online Purchase via Predictive Modelling

1.1 File Name:
• zip-folder: use_case_1.zip
• PSP_Jan_Feb_2019.xlsx : list of credit card transactions for DACH countries (Germany, Switzerland, Austria)

1.2 List of PSPs (=payments service providers) and service fees:
name Feeonsuccessfultransactions Feeonfailedtransactions
Moneycard 5 Euro 2 Euro
Goldcard 10 Euro 5 Euro
UK_Card 3 Euro 1 Euro
Simplecard 1 Euro 0,5 Euro

1.1 Column Description:
• tmsp: timestamp of transaction
• country: country of transaction
• amount: transaction amount
• success: is 1 if payment is successful
• PSP: name of payments service provider
• 3D_secured: is 1 if customer is 3D identified (i.e. more secure online credit card payments)
• card: credit card provider (Master, Visa, Diners)

1.2 Additional Info from Business Side:
• Many transactions fail at the first try. Therefore, customers try several times to transfer the money. If
two transactions are within one minute, with the same amount of money and from the same country, it
is (for a decent number of tries) safe to assume that they are payment attempts of the same purchase.
Consider this possibility of several payment attempts of the same purchase in your machine learning
model!
